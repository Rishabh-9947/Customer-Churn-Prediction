# Customer-Churn-Prediction
Predicting customer churn for bank savings accounts using machine learning.

## Project Overview
This project aims to predict customer churn for a bank's savings account product. Using demographic and transactional data, we identify customers likely to churn due to balances falling below the minimum required.

## Data Description
The dataset includes demographic information (age, gender, occupation, city), customer bank relationship details (net worth category, branch code, days since last transaction), and transactional information (current balance, previous month's balance, credit and debit amounts). The target variable is churn, indicating whether a customer's average balance falls below the minimum balance in the next quarter.
