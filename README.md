# Customer-Churn-Prediction
Predicting customer churn for bank savings accounts using machine learning.

### Project Overview
This project aims to predict customer churn for a bank's savings account product. Using demographic and transactional data, we identify customers likely to churn due to balances falling below the minimum required.

### Data Description
The dataset includes demographic information (age, gender, occupation, city), customer bank relationship details (net worth category, branch code, days since last transaction), and transactional information (current balance, previous month's balance, credit and debit amounts). The target variable is churn, indicating whether a customer's average balance falls below the minimum balance in the next quarter.

### Installation
To run this project, install the required libraries as listed in `requirements.txt`:

## pip install -r requirements.txt
### Usage
Execute the Jupyter notebook `Bank Data Chrun.ipynb.ipynb` to follow the data analysis, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation steps.

### Results and Conclusion
Key findings and insights from the analysis will be summarized here, including the performance of the predictive model and recommendations for reducing customer churn.

### Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas for data manipulation
- Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualization
- Scikit-learn for machine learning

# Customer Churn Prediction for Bank Savings Accounts

## Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting customer churn for a bank's savings account product. The objective is to identify customers likely to churn, i.e., whose account balances may fall below the minimum required balance, using demographic and transactional data.

## Data Description
The dataset encompasses various aspects of customer information, divided into three main categories:

- **Demographic Information**: Includes customer ID, age, gender, number of dependents, occupation, and city.
- **Customer Bank Relationship**: Covers the vintage of the customer with the bank, net worth category, branch code, and days since the last transaction.
- **Transactional Information**: Encompasses current balance, previous month's balance, average monthly balances in previous quarters, credit and debit amounts for the current and previous months, and churn indication (1 if the average balance falls below the minimum balance in the next quarter, 0 otherwise).

## Installation
To set up the project environment, install the required Python packages using the following command:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Usage
The analysis is documented in a Jupyter notebook named `Bank Data Chrun.ipynb`. To view the analysis, run:
jupyter notebook `Bank Data Chrun.ipynb.ipynb`


## Results
The project identifies key predictors of customer churn and employs machine learning models to predict the likelihood of churn for each customer. The findings and recommendations for improving customer retention are detailed in the notebook.

## Technologies Used
- Python for data processing and machine learning.
- Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation.
- Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization.
- Scikit-learn for predictive modeling.
