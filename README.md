# Customer-Churn-Prediction
Predicting customer churn for bank savings accounts using machine learning.

## Project Overview
This project aims to predict customer churn for a bank's savings account product. Using demographic and transactional data, we identify customers likely to churn due to balances falling below the minimum required.

## Data Description
The dataset includes demographic information (age, gender, occupation, city), customer bank relationship details (net worth category, branch code, days since last transaction), and transactional information (current balance, previous month's balance, credit and debit amounts). The target variable is churn, indicating whether a customer's average balance falls below the minimum balance in the next quarter.

## Installation
To run this project, install the required libraries as listed in `requirements.txt`:

## pip install -r requirements.txt
### Usage
Execute the Jupyter notebook `churn_prediction_analysis.ipynb` to follow the data analysis, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation steps.

### Results and Conclusion
Key findings and insights from the analysis will be summarized here, including the performance of the predictive model and recommendations for reducing customer churn.

### Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas for data manipulation
- Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualization
- Scikit-learn for machine learning
